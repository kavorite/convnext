**A 2020s [ConvNet] Implementation**

*Default stage depths are substituted for those found in* <br>
*[High-Performance Image Recognition][NFNets] that don't utilize* <br>
*normalization but are used on a large scale.*

*These arrangements are somewhat better motivated compared* <br>
*to those of the* ***ConvNeXt Authors*** *, who favored architectures* <br>
*with computational loads roughly comparable to their baselines* <br>
*in order to generate `experimentally valid results`.*

## Norms

The interface supports not only **ConvNeXt** <br>
**LayerNorm**, but also baseline **BatchNorm**.

Specifying `norm = None` in the model constructor will result<br>
in `norm-free` weight standardization as employed in **[NFNets]**.


## Example

```python
import haiku
import jax

from convnext import ConvNeXt


def ConvNextT(inputs,is_training = True):
    cnn = ConvNeXt(depths = [ 3 , 3 , 9 , 3 ])
    logits = cnn(inputs,is_training)
    return logits


rng = haiku.PRNGSequence(42)

inputs = jax.random.truncated_normal(next(rng),-1,1,(1,224,224,3))

params , state = haiku.transform_with_state(ConvNextT)
   .init(next(rng),inputs)

logits = haiku.transform_with_state(ConvNextT)
   .apply(params,state,next(rng),inputs)
```
